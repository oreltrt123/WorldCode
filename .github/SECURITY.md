## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CodinIT.dev seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üîí Responsible Disclosure

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us directly at: **gerome.e24@gmail.com**
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Affected versions, browsers, or configurations
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept (if applicable)

### ‚è∞ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-7 days depending on complexity
- **Fix Development**: 1-14 days depending on severity
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

Our application implements multiple security layers:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: Industry-standard authentication with JWT tokens
- **Team-based Access Control**: Multi-tenant isolation
- **Session Management**: Secure token rotation and expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis-based request throttling

#### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, size limits, and content scanning
- **Sandbox Isolation**: E2B sandboxed execution environment
- **No Persistent Storage**: Temporary file processing only

#### API Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies
- **Request Validation**: Schema validation using Zod
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses without sensitive data
- **Timeout Protection**: Request and execution timeout limits

#### Code Generation Security
- **Strict Constraints**: No external dependency injection
- **File System Isolation**: Operations limited to uploaded files only
- **Content Filtering**: Prohibited code pattern detection
- **AST Validation**: Abstract syntax tree validation for safe code generation

#### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration secured
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring

### üîç Security Best Practices for Users

When using CodinIT:

1. **File Uploads**: Only upload files you own or have permission to process
2. **Sensitive Data**: Never upload files containing credentials, API keys, or personal data
3. **Code Review**: Always review generated code before deployment
4. **Access Control**: Limit team access to necessary members only
5. **API Keys**: Use dedicated API keys with minimal required permissions

### üö® Known Security Considerations

#### File Processing
- Uploaded files are processed in isolated E2B sandboxes
- Files are automatically deleted after processing
- No persistent storage of user code or data

#### Code Generation
- Generated code is validated but should be reviewed before production use
- AI-generated code may contain patterns requiring security review
- External dependencies are explicitly prohibited in generated code

#### Third-Party Integrations
- **Supabase**: Handles authentication and user management
- **E2B**: Provides isolated code execution environments
- **Upstash**: Manages rate limiting and temporary data
- **Vercel**: Hosts the application with security best practices

### üìú Compliance

We are committed to maintaining compliance with:

- **GDPR**: European data protection regulations
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls
- **Industry Standards**: Following OWASP security guidelines

### üîÑ Security Updates

- Security patches are prioritized and deployed immediately
- Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities
- Security advisories are published for critical issues

### üìû Contact Information

For security-related inquiries:
- **Email**: gerome.e24@gmail.com
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Encryption**: PGP key available upon request

### üèÜ Security Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure and may recognize security researchers who help improve our security posture:

- Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- Hall of fame listing
- Potential monetary rewards for critical vulnerabilities (case-by-case basis)
